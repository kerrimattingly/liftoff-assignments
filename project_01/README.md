# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview
ShopHappy is a web application that helps a shopper keep track of items they want to buy, as well as where they want to buy those items. A shopper can store information about the items that are purchased most frequently, and add items to a list to remember to purchase them on the next shopping trip. A shopper can create multiple lists, categorizing them in different ways that can help keep them organized, such as according to which store carries the item. Lists can be edited and deleted, as needed. And items/products that are input can also be edited or deleted as needed, as well.
