Brief description of topic: Presenter Jeff Brown of OCI. A presentation of the various features of GORM, an ORM tool. It offers convenient features to allow a developer to implement a data layer much more easily.
Questions: What is the method for adding this tool to a web application-- what are the specific lines of code needed? How could this be put to use in the project I'm developing? I can learn more by going to the online GORM manual.
Summary of what I learned & where to learn more: Learned about a new framework, Grails. The presenter had published a youtube video earlier the day of the presentation which I would plan to watch to learn more about Grails.
